Gaz
==============

Tetris has always been an addiction of mine. I decided to eradicate it by "solving" it so I'll never want to play it again.

In case no one gets the [reference](http://zim.wikia.com/wiki/Gaz_Membrane). Gaz keeps playing tetris in order to try and make itself better. Very selfish, and has no remorse.

The only dependency for this repo is ```pygame```. To install,

If you have pip
```bash
pip install pygame 
```

or if you don't
```bash
sudo apt-get install python-pygame
```

Instructions
---------------------

Currently there are 3 ways to use Gaz. 

1. Normal Tetris
... By running ```python tetris.py``` you can play normal tetris as Alexey Pajitnov intended
